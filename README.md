# Handtracking Angry Bird

This project is the final project for the computer vision class. The goal of this project is to create a game where the player can control an Angry Bird character using hand tracking.

## Description

In this project, we will be using computer vision techniques to track the movement of the player's hand and map it to the movement of the Angry Bird character in the game. The player will be able to control the bird's position, angle, and velocity by moving their hand in front of a camera.

This repository serves as the webpage for our project. You can find the source code of the model and the Python script for playing the game in the following repository:
